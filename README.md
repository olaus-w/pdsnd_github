### Project Title
Revision of Udacity Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project allows the user to review a subset of data for bikeshare rides in three different cities: Chicago, Washington DC, and New York City.

After selecting the city the user can filter by month and/or day of the week if desired. The following results are then displayed:

    - Popular travel times are displayed (most popular month, day of week, and hour of day) unless a filter is set that would invalidate that parameter.

    - The most popular start station, stop station, and pair of starting and stopping stations are displayed.

    - The average and total travel times are displayed.

    - Information about the users including how many are subscribers, and if New York City or Chicago are selected, gender, and age data (earliest birth year, latest birth year, and most common birth year)

After displaying these data the user has the option to view the filtered raw data five lines at a time. 

### Files used
This project consists of bikeshare.py and three precleaned data files provided by Udacity: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv.

### Credits
It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.
